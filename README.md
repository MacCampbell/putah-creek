For examining parentage of Putah Creek Chinook

### The Story

Putah Creek is a Sacramento River tributary with returning Chinook salmon. It has been known to have a fall run population (Yoshiyama et al. 1998). Otolith microchemistry indicates salmon spawning in Putah Creek now are from a variety of sources, ~88% appear to be from Central Valley hatcheries (https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsh.10516).   The ability of juveniles to survive and return to spawn in Putah Creek, and the creation of a self-sustaining population is unknown.   We have a set of Chinook salmon from 2016-2021 and the goal is to identify family-level relationships to see if any of these fish produced offspring.  

Most Chinook salmon in the stream are probably 2-3 years old (Freshwater annuli=0, saltwater annuli=2-3), with a few 4 year old fish.
